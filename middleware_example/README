Fun little "middleware" example with Sinatra.

This trivial example adds a "thing" to a box when visiting
/inbox/<some string>

The list of things within the box are displayed as subsequent items are added.

Calling /clear will trigger the middleware route to clear the app.settings
structure. The main application file is also re-loaded. Middleware like this
is very handy when developing sinatra apps, as changes can be made to the app file and re-loaded by visiting /clear or whatever to trigger the middleware reload.
